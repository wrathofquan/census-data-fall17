## Census Confidentiality


- Census says it never wants to disclose information that could lead to an identity of a person or household

- How confidential? WWII

- Census and Pizza Delivery?







## Decennial Census Data


- Counts voting age population for redistricting

- Census Long Form: 1940-2000
    - Sampled 1 in 6 households(~17%)



- Problems
    - 10 year wait for new data
    - Many grant programs require census data
    - Researchers and local communities wanted more current information

## American Community Survey (ACS)


- Replaces the Decennial Census Long Form with over 60 questions.

- 3 millions households/year receive a form (250,000 households per month)

- ACS started in 2005 to provide more current data

- Provides a snapshop of areas based on a rolling 1 year and 5 year average.
