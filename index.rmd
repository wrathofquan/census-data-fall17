## Introduction to the U.S Census and the American Community Survey

Fall 2017






## Why does the U.S have a census?

Congressional Redistricting!

> "The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct."


Article 1, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution.

## Census Geography

To find Census information, you need to understand Census Geography

## Census Confidentiality


- Census says it never wants to disclose information that could lead to an identity of a person or household

- How confidential? [WWII and Japanese Internment](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/confirmed-the-us-census-b/)








## Decennial Census Data


- Counts voting age population for redistricting
<br><br>
- Census Short Form: Basic demographics data: age, sex, race, Hispanic/Latino
origin, household relationship, residence owned or rented
    - Data asked of everyone
<br><br>
- Census Long Form: 1940-2000
    - Sampled 1 in 6 households(~17%)

## Decennial Census Data

- Problems
    - 10 year wait for new data
    - Many grant programs require census data
    - Researchers and local communities wanted more current information
    


-----





## American Community Survey (ACS)


- Replaces the Decennial Census Long Form with over 60 questions.

- 3 millions households/year receive a form (250,000 households per month)

- ACS started in 2005 to provide more current data

- Provides a snapshop of areas based on a rolling 1, 3, and 5 year average. 

- ACS is not a census -- ACS is a survey

## Comparing Across Time Periods in ACS

- Be aware of changes in Census geography-more common in small area geography.

- Compare estimates from same time spans
    - 1 year to 1 year
    - 3 year to 3 year
    - 5 year to 5 year
   
- Compare non-overlapping time period

- Be aware of changes in wording of questions


## Race and Ethnicity
